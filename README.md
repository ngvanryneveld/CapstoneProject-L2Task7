# Poised Project Management
This program was built to store projects, clients, contractors and architects for a construction company.
The Poised.java file is the main for running the program and calls onto the other .java classes in the file.
The user of the program will select whichever option from the menu and the corresponding action will happen, many of these actions will guide the user to put inputs in various positions.

The user can edit any variable for a project, client, contractor or architect. 
The program can print out an invoice into a text file for selected projects with balance outstanding.

This program does not externally store any data so once the program is closed, the information is lost.
